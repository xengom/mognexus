I am a passionate IT professional with a dual role as a SI Backend Developer and DevOps Engineer since 2021. During my career, I have gained extensive experience in developing and maintaining enterprise-level software solutions while ensuring smooth operations and deployment processes.
As a Backend Developer, I specialize in system integration, creating robust APIs, and implementing efficient database solutions. My work involves collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software that meets business requirements.
In my DevOps role, I focus on streamlining development workflows, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and managing cloud infrastructure. I am committed to bridging the gap between development and operations, ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery.
My experience in both roles has given me a comprehensive understanding of the software development lifecycle, from coding to deployment and maintenance. I am constantly learning and adapting to new technologies to stay current with industry best practices.
I am eager to take on new challenges and contribute my skills to innovative projects that make a meaningful impact.
